                I'm a passionate full-stack developer specializing in Angular,
                Node.js, TypeScript, and MongoDB, with a strong focus on backend
                development. Iâ€™m always eager to learn, currently exploring
                React and Java to broaden my skills. My love for programming
                stems from its rewarding learning curve, and I thrive on solving
                problems and delivering optimal solutions.
              </P>

                My journey began at age 12 with Python, sparking my passion for
                this field. At 16, I formalized my studies through a technical
                course at SENAI, where I worked on diverse projects, including
                my capstone project, which remains a significant milestone in my
                career.
              </P>

              <P>
                Currently, Iâ€™m wrapping up Soundbrary, my most ambitious project
                to date, which is in the testing phase and soon to be deployed.
                My portfolio is ever-growing, with highlights like a Node.js
                Spotify API integration project used in Soundbrary.
              </P>
              <P>
                I thrive in collaborative environments. My capstone experience
                involved constant teamwork, fostering knowledge sharing and
                minimizing errors. Outside of programming, I enjoy playing
                guitar and acoustic guitar, diving into classic single-player
                games, and watching anime and series.
              </P>

                You can find me sharing achievements and projects on LinkedIn
                and showcasing my work on GitHub. Iâ€™m open to freelance
                opportunities, particularly in web application development,
                always ready to embrace new challenges. In the future, I see
                myself as a backend developer contributing creative solutions
                and perhaps leading innovative products. Letâ€™s build something
                amazing together! ðŸš€
